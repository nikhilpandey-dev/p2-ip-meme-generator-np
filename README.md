# Meme Generator

> The goal of this project is to build a "meme generator" – a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote.

## What Will I Build?
You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a dynamic data-rich application to generate images with quotes.

## Requirements

- The application you build must
    - Interact with a variety of complex filetypes. This emulates the kind of data you’ll encounter in a data engineering role.
    - Load quotes from a variety of filetypes (PDF, Word Documents, CSVs, Text files).
    - Load, manipulate, and save images.
    - Accept dynamic user input through a command-line tool and a web service. This emulates the kind of work you’ll encounter as a full stack developer.

## Key Learning Highlights
- This project will give you a hands-on opportunity to practice what you've learned in this course, such as:
    - Object-oriented thinking in Python, including abstract classes, class methods, and static methods.
    - DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principles of class and method design.
    - Working with modules and packages in Python.

> As you're building your project, be sure to demonstrate coding best practices for style and documentation. Ensure your code, docstrings, and comments adhere to [PEP 8 Standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
